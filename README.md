# iFree App

A mobile application for freestyle rap events and tournaments.

## Building the iOS App with GitHub Actions

This repository is configured to build the iOS app automatically using GitHub Actions, bypassing the Expo EAS build service limits.

### How it Works

1. **Local Build on GitHub Runners**: Instead of using Expo's build service (which has monthly limits on the free tier), the workflow builds the app directly on GitHub's macOS runners.

2. **The Process**:
   - Checks out the repository code
   - Sets up Node.js, Ruby, and Xcode environments
   - Installs all necessary dependencies
   - Generates native iOS code using `expo prebuild`
   - Installs CocoaPods dependencies
   - Builds the app using `xcodebuild`
   - Uploads the build as an artifact

3. **Downloading the Build**:
   - Go to the "Actions" tab in the GitHub repository
   - Select the most recent workflow run
   - Scroll down to the "Artifacts" section
   - Download the "ios-build" artifact
   - Extract the .zip file to access the iOS app

### Requirements

- A GitHub repository
- An Expo token stored as a repository secret (EXPO_TOKEN)

### Setup Instructions

1. **Expo Token**:
   - Visit [Expo Access Tokens](https://expo.dev/settings/access-tokens)
   - Create a new token
   - Go to your GitHub repository's Settings > Secrets > Actions
   - Add a new repository secret named `EXPO_TOKEN` with the value of your Expo token

2. **Trigger a Build**:
   - Push to the repository to trigger the workflow automatically
   - Monitor the build in the "Actions" tab

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter build issues:

- Check that your Expo token is correctly set in the repository secrets
- Ensure all necessary environment variables are properly configured
- Review the workflow logs for any error messages
- Verify that your app.json configuration is correct

## Development

To develop the app locally:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm start

# Open iOS simulator
npm run ios

# Open Android emulator
npm run android
```

## Features
